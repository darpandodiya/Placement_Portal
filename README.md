The project took 3 months due to the tight schedule of the college. The team consisted of me, Tanmay Rajani and Joel Pinto. As our primary target was to learn the technologies, we didn’t use any framework and coded most of the modules of our own. It has sparked an urge in me to dig deeper into the niche of web development.
